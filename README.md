<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project started when I wanted to create a website that was used to represent the results of the project I created. Many out there have made it like this, but I am more challenged to develop this portfolio website using existing references.

Why use this:

-   Make it easier for you to share the results of your projects with the world
-   Writing portfolios becomes more efficient anytime and anywhere
-   Responsive user interface

Of course, this project wouldn't be perfect without references from great people out there. Thanks to everyone for supporting me to develop this project!
